## Instructions ##

*It's a design that uses micro bit humidity sensors for automatic watering. When the humidity dropped below a predetermined value, servo turned the machine's shaft to water it.

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was (insert something here).

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as (insert something here).

### Part 1 Preparation  ###

Watch the video to get an idea of how the restoration project will work.

After watching the video, I began to think about how the original design was designed and made.

PS: I think the design and logic is the focus of my restoration project.

(BUY FROM JAYCAR! Thanks to Angle for sharing this information, you can go to Jaycar and get the parts you need.)

Due to the lack of some materials such as flexible Straw, so I had to find a solution.
Although the appearance is a bit uncomfortable and beautiful, but at least it can ensure that it can work properly. Once the material is ready, the next phase begins

#### Production Phase ####

This stage consists of two parts: Coding and device fabrication.
